Running the Script
The run_analysis.R does the following.
1.	Merges the training and the test sets from the data set available from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set, named NewData, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Detailed information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
